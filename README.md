# JSON navigation

A module for navigating through the JSON

## How to use

After the start you should enter the path to the JSON file.

Then the program "enters" the file and the navigation begins.

On each step you have up to three options - to exit, to go up and to go down.

Also, after each step your location in the JSON object is displayed by your path.

On each step you're provided with additional info about the latest entered container or value.
For dictionaries it is keys, for lists - their length and for other objects - their types and value.
